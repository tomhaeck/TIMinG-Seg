* T1-weighted MR image (T1) is the average of 27 scans of the same normal subject.

* Spatial probabilities of white matter (WM), grey matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are also included.  The white matter probabilities were normalized such that the spatial probabilities of WM, GM and CSF sum to 1.0 for every voxel. 

* The spatial probabilities were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 1x1x1mm.

* T1 and the spatial probabilities were downsampled with a factor 2 in every dimension to limit the size of the TIMinG-Seg software package.
